Two waves (each with a wavelength of 2.0 m) meet in phase. Determine the amplitude of the resultant wave if the first wave's amplitude is 5.0 cm and the second wave's amplitude is 4.0 cm.
An earthquake produces longitudinal waves that move through rock with a frequency of 15 Hz and have wavelengths of 682 m. Determine how long it will take for these waves to travel 30 km.
Students take photographs of waves at the boundaries in water tank. They analyze the photographs and measure several sets of wave crests. The horizontal distance from a waves crest to trough is measured as 12. 5 cm. If the speed of the wave generator that makes each wave was set 2.85 m/s. Determine the frequency of the waves.
From the previous question determine the number of waves that would strike the side of the water tank in exactly 1.00 minute.
Determine the frequency of a sound wave with a wavelength of 5.0 m and a speed of 330 m/s.
