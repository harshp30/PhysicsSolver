A force of 600 N is applied to a box by an attached rope. As a result the box is moved 15 m across a rough level floor at constant velocity. The rope makes an angle of 46 degrees with the floor. Determine the work done on the box.
A rifle fires a 10.0 g steel bullet with a muzzle velocity of 400 m/s into a block of wood. The bullet penetrates the wood a distance of 12.0 cm before coming to rest. Determine the average frictional force between the bullet and the wood.
A 1.00 kg pendulum is released from a certain height. At the lowest point in its swing the speed of the bob is 2.3 m/s. Calculate the vertical distance from which the pendulum is released.
